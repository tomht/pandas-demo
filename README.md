# Pandas Demo
This is a simple demo of pandas, with 5 scripts showing its basic features.

**[pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)** is an open source data analysis library for Python.

Scripts 1-5 demonstrate, respectively:
1. Reading and plotting
2. Selecting
3. Filtering
4. Aggregation
5. Cleaning data

The code and data in this demo were taken and adapted from the [pandas cookbook](https://github.com/jvns/pandas-cookbook), which is an excellent resource and a great way to get started with pandas.
